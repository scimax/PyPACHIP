# PyPACHIP
PyPACHIP - Python Proton Accelerator on a Chip Simulation


# Using standalone
In this case, no python version or something similar is required. You can simply download the executable and run it.

# Using as python scripts
When running the scripts directly, the following is required:
- Python 3.5
- Packages:
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - matplotlib
  - wxpython phoenix

The last one is not available at the python package index yet since it's still under development. You can find it here.

Otherwise use pip with the requirements.txt file provided in the repo.
